magnolia-thymeleaf-renderer
================================

This is a working, fully functional integration of the thymeleaf template engine into magnolia cms

It supports blossom (spring-mvc) templates. If someone wants to have a pure STK integration lease let me know.

The custom dialect comes with cms:init, cms:area and cms:component


To see how the blossom-serlvet needs to be setup, and how to use the magnolia processors take a look at the example web app and the [wiki pages](https://github.com/eiswind/magnolia-thymeleaf-renderer/wiki).

December 2014: Update to Magnolia 5.3.6 and Spring4. Added basic testing.

Oktober 2014: Updated the dependencies and the example to magnolia 5.3.4 and blossom 3.0.4, now depending on bundled wepapp artifact

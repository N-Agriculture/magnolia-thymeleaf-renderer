magnolia-blossom-thymeleaf-proto
================================

This is a working, fully functional prototype for an integration of thymeleaf into magnolia cms

It currently supports only blossom templates with spring annotated controllers

The custom dialect comes with cms:init, cms:area and cms:component

To see how the blossom-serlvet needs to be setup, and how to use the magnolia processors take a look at the example web app

January 2014: Updated the dependencies and the example to magnolia 5.2.1 and blossom 3.0
